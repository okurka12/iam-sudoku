Sudoku (harder, bonus) Deadline: unrestricted Encode Sudoku into a
propositional formula. Write a program that, given an instance of Sudoku,
outputs a CNF formula (in the DIMACS format) that is satisfiable iff the
instance has a solution. Suppose that the input instance is given as a sequence
of lines of the format r c v where r denotes the row number (1--9), c denotes
the column number (1--9), and v denotes the value at the position [r,c] (again,
1--9). E.g. consider the following instance:

copied from Wikipedia

The input of the instance would look like this:

1 1 5
1 2 3
1 5 7
2 1 6
2 4 1
...
9 9 9

Solve the instance above using a SAT solver. (Please, encode the input line of
the form 1 2 3 as a variable with the number 123 to simplify grading.) Send the
program and the model to "lengal@fit.vutbr.cz" with the subject 
"[IAM] [SUDOKU]".
